This project was created in order to determine the different strengths and weaknesses of various data structures, such as doubly linked lists, heaps, and hah table's. The program takes 10000 random integers and inputs them into the array. The program then inserts, searchs, and sorts 100 integers at a time. The program takes the time of these operations and divides this number by 100, giving the avergae, insert and search times for the first 100 numbers, second 100 and so on. In the files included in the project is also the final report file which explains the differences in the performances of the different data structure.
